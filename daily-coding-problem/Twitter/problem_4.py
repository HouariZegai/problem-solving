""" Asked by: Twitter [Easy].

A permutation can be specified by an array P, 
where P[i] represents the location of the element at i in the permutation. 
For example, [2, 1, 0] represents the permutation where elements at the index 0 and 2 are swapped.

Given an array and a permutation, apply the permutation to the array. 
For example, given the array ["a", "b", "c"] and the permutation [2, 1, 0], return ["c", "b", "a"].
