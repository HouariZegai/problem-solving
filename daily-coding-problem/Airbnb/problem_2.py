""" Asked by: Airbnb [Hard].

We're given a hashmap associating each courseId key with a list of courseIds values, which represents that the prerequisites of courseId 
are courseIds. Return a sorted ordering of courses such that we can finish all courses.

Return null if there is no such ordering.

For example, given {'CSC300': ['CSC100', 'CSC200'], 'CSC200': ['CSC100'], 'CSC100': []}, should return ['CSC100', 'CSC200', 'CSCS300'].
