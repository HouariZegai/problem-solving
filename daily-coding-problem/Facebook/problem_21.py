""" Asked by: Facebook [Easy].

You have a large array with most of the elements as zero.

Use a more space-efficient data structure, SparseArray, that implements the same interface:

init(arr, size): initialize with the original large array and size.
set(i, val): updates index at i with val.
get(i): gets the value at index i.
