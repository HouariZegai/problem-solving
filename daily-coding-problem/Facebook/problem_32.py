""" Asked by: Facebook [Easy].

Boggle is a game played on a 4 x 4 grid of letters. 
The goal is to find as many words as possible that can be formed by a sequence of adjacent letters in the grid, using each cell at most once. 
Given a game board and a dictionary of valid words, implement a Boggle solver.
