""" Asked by: Facebook [Medium].

Given a number in Roman numeral format, convert it to decimal.

The values of Roman numerals are as follows:

{
    'M': 1000,
    'D': 500,
    'C': 100,
    'L': 50,
    'X': 10,
    'V': 5,
    'I': 1
}
In addition, note that the Roman numeral system uses subtractive notation for numbers such as IV and XL.

For the input XIV, for instance, you should return 14.
