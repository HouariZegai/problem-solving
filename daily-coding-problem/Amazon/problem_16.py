""" Asked by: Amazon [Easy]

You are given a list of data entries that represent entries and exits of groups of people into a building. An entry looks like this:

{"timestamp": 1526579928, count: 3, "type": "enter"}

This means 3 people entered the building. An exit looks like this:

{"timestamp": 1526580382, count: 2, "type": "exit"}

This means that 2 people exited the building. timestamp is in Unix time.

Find the busiest period in the building, that is, the time with the most people in the building. 
Return it as a pair of (start, end) timestamps. You can assume the building always starts off and ends up empty, i.e. with 0 people inside.
