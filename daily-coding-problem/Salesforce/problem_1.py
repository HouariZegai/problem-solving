Connect 4 is a game where opponents take turns dropping red or black discs into a 
7 x 6 vertically suspended grid. The game ends either when one player creates a line 
of four consecutive discs of their color (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), 
or when there are no more spots left in the grid.

Design and implement Connect 4.
