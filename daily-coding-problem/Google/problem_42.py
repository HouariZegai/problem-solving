""" Asked by: Google [Medium].

Given a set of closed intervals, find the smallest set of numbers that covers all the intervals. 
If there are multiple smallest sets, return any of them.

For example, given the intervals [0, 3], [2, 6], [3, 4], [6, 9], one set of numbers that covers all these intervals is {3, 6}.
