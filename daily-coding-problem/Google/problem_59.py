""" Asked by: Google [Easy].

Given two rectangles on a 2D graph, return the area of their intersection. If the rectangles don't intersect, return 0.

For example, given the following rectangles:

{
    "top_left": (1, 4),
    "dimensions": (3, 3) # width, height
}
and

{
    "top_left": (0, 5),
    "dimensions": (4, 3) # width, height
}
return 6.
