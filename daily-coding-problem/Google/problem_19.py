""" Asked by: Google [Hard].

Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache. 
It should be able to be initialized with a cache size n, and contain the following methods:

    set(key, value): sets key to value. If there are already n items in the cache and we are adding a new item, 
    then it should also remove the least recently used item.
    get(key): gets the value at key. If no such key exists, return null.

Each operation should run in O(1) time.
