""" Asked by: Google [Hard].

Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of s. 
A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants. 
The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.
