""" Asked by: Jane Street [Hard].

Suppose you are given a table of currency exchange rates, represented as a 2D array.
Determine whether there is a possible arbitrage: that is, whether there is some sequence of trades you can make,
starting with some amount A of any currency, so that you can end up with some amount greater than A of that currency.

There are no transaction costs and you can trade fractional quantities.
